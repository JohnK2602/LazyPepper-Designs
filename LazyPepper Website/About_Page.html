                        Hello, I’m Eddie Moore, owner of LazyPepper Designs. We’re located in Kingstree, SC. A nice,
                        quiet
                        place to live, work and enjoy the beautiful surroundings that God has blessed us with. I have a
                        wonderful family that doesn’t mind supporting my hobbies.

                        If you’re wondering where the name LazyPepper comes from, well it’s a simple story. I have been
                        crafting, drawing, and woodworking for a long time. A gift my father and brother instilled in me
                        when I was a teenager. My dad used to make Christmas gifts for our family every year and made
                        some
                        of the furniture in our house, including an oak banquet table for the dining room. I learned to
                        use
                        hand
                        and power tools back then as well as learning to work on cars and welding too. I learned to bake
                        and
                        make sweets from my mom and make BBQ and chicken bog from my dad. In my twenties, our family did
                        a
                        little catering on the side. I continued to cook for people off and on and eventually came up
                        with
                        The Lazy Pepper as my catering name. I still cook and bake but now I only do it for fun.

                <div class="text-box">
                    <p>
                        Over the years I continued to dabble in woodworking and even built my own kitchen cabinets
                        during our house
                        renovations. That brings us to my woodworking business. I became fascinated with charcuterie and
                        cutting boards and then epoxy work. The more I experimented, the more fun and interesting it
                        became.
                        I started selling at our town’s farmer’s market and did well enough to continue the efforts. It
                        then
                        became necessary to come up with a name. I always liked LazyPepper and decided to stick with it.
                        Even though the name fits better with food, it certainly gets people’s attention, which is what
                        a
                        good business name should do.

                    I currently make charcuterie and cutting boards, noodle boards, epoxy river
                    boards,
                    wine barrel crafts and furniture. Although this is still not my primary occupation, I enjoy it
                    enough toalways learn new things and try to perfect my craft. I hope you enjoy browsing our website
                    and come
                    back to see what new things we have from time to time. <br><br>

                    Thank you for stopping by, <br><br>
